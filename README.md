# Online-Banking-System
Through this project work, we aim to create a simplified version of a banking  application. T
he application will act as a portal which provides itâ€™s users with  various banking facilities like account management and transaction  management. 
The aim is to learn how to create an application which uses a  database in its backend. 
We also plan to make the application safe and  secure so that it is not susceptible to vulnerabilities and security attacks.
